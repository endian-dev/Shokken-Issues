# SMS Consent for Shokken Waitlist Texts

This page explains how guests opt in to receive Shokken text messages and what those messages include.

## What Shokken is

Shokken is a waitlist management app used by restaurant host stands. When you join a restaurant’s waitlist, Shokken can send you text updates about your place in line and when your table is ready.

Shokken messages are **transactional waitlist updates** (not marketing).

## How guests opt in (verbal consent at the restaurant)

Guests opt in **verbally, in person**, at the restaurant.

A host will ask for permission to text waitlist updates. If you say yes, the host enters your mobile number into Shokken and you receive waitlist messages for that visit.

### Verbal opt-in script (what the host says)

> “Can I text you waitlist updates from **Shokken** for **[Restaurant Name]**? You’ll get messages about your place in line and when your table is ready. Message frequency varies. Message & data rates may apply. You can opt out any time by replying **STOP**.”

If you agree, the host will ask for your mobile number and add you to the waitlist.

### Example opt-in conversation

**Host:** “Can I text you waitlist updates from Shokken for [Restaurant Name]? You’ll get messages about your place in line and when your table is ready. Message frequency varies. Message & data rates may apply. You can opt out any time by replying STOP.”
**Guest:** “Yes.”
**Host:** “Great — what’s your mobile number?”
**Guest:** “[Phone number]”
**Host:** “Thanks — you’ll get a text shortly.”

## What messages you’ll receive

Shokken may send messages such as:

1. **Confirmation when you’re added to the waitlist**
2. **A “table ready” notification**
3. **A dismissal/removal message** (for example, if you leave or the waitlist is cleared)
