## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### Is Shokken free?
Shokken is free to test. Once it hits the market, Shokken will be free to start with Email notifications for guests. To enable SMS notification, a competitive subscription plan will be available.

### The app is asking me to pay to subscribe. I thought testing is free?
- Purchases in the test app are test purchases and will not charge your credit card
- Purchases are valid for just a few minutes per billing cycle
- The subscription will usually cancel itself after just a few hours
- You will receive subscription emails from Google Play Store and Apple App Store as if you made a real purchase. However, Google and Apple will mark them as test purchases
