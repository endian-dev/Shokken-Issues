# Shokken Issue Tracker

## ℹ️ What is Shokken?

Shokken is a buzzer/pager system replacement for busy boutique restaurants. It allows hosts to enter guests in virtual waitlists and notify them by Email/SMS when they are ready to be seated.

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### Is Shokken free?
Shokken is free to test. Once it hits the market, Shokken will be free to start with Email notifications for guests. To enable SMS notifications, a competitive subscription plan will be available.

### The app is asking me to pay to subscribe. I thought testing is free?
- **You will NOT be charged** - All purchases in the test app are simulated
- Test subscriptions expire quickly (minutes instead of months)
- Test subscriptions auto-cancel within a few hours
- You'll receive confirmation emails from Google/Apple marked as "TEST" - these are not real charges

### Can I use Shokken offline?
No. Shokken requires a constant internet connection to function.
